# Burger
### UNC Coding BootCamp Express/Handlebars Homework Assignment
### By: Charles Bowden

## What is Burger?
Burger let's users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, and then the page renders that input along with a button that allows users to "eat" their (or someone else's) burger, sort of like checking it off the list.  

The primary purpose of this app is simply to see how much MySql, Node, Express, and Handlebars were learned over the past couple weeks!.  Burger takes in form data, writes it to at MySql database using express to take various requests, and uses Handlebars to render the pages.

## How can you try it out?

* NodeJS

* The following NPM packages:
  * Express
